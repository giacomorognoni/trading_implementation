# trading_implementation
An implementation of various trading strategies and attempted enhancement using neural networks.

## description
A comparison of various trading strategies to identify the most
effective and attempt enhancement through Neural Networks. The trading
strategies considered are:
    * Moving Average Crossover
    * Dual Moving Average Crossover
    * Exponential Moving Average Crossover
    * Mean Reversion
    * Pairs Trading
    
The Neural Network used for enhancement includes: 
    * 1 input layer, 1 hidden layer, 1 output layer
    * Relu activation function for the first two layers
    * Adam optimisation function
    * MSE error function
